# My Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal academic website, built with the [Hugo Academic Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic), customized to use the **Satoshi** font and a **custom color palette**.

## About
The site showcases my research, publications, projects, and other professional activities. It is deployed via netlify, hosted on github, and uses Hugo for fast, static site generation.

## Customizations
- **Typography:** Replaced the default theme fonts with [Satoshi](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi) for a clean, modern look.
- **Color Palette:** Modified the theme’s default colors to match my personal branding.
- **Content Structure:** Personalized sections for research, publications, and projects.

## Structure
- **content/** – Main content pages (home, publications, blog, projects, etc.)
- **static/** – Static files such as images and PDFs
- **config/** – Site configuration files
- **themes/** – Academic theme files
