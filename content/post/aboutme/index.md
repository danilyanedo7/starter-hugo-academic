Hi! I’m Edo Danilyan, a PhD researcher at the University of Vienna. My work focuses on understanding how microbes grow, interact, and influence the environments they live in. My work combines field observations, controlled experiments, and a bit of programming magic to explore how microbial communities grow, interact, and adapt across environments.

Right now, I’m pursuing my PhD as part of the **FWF Microplanet: Microbiomes Drive Planetary Health** project, where I study microbial biomass and metabolism, particularly in aquatic systems. I spend a good amount of time tinkering with lifescale, running chemostats, culturing microbes, and writing code to make sense of all the data.

Before my PhD, I earned my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in biology from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. During that time, I worked on projects ranging from microbial applications in sustainable construction to environmental microbiology. Along the way, I discovered that I enjoyed the process of asking questions as much as finding the answers. [Read the full story here](/post/dream)

I'm happiest when science meets storytelling, whether it's through thoughtful data visualizations, reproducible code, or simply making complex ideas a bit easier to grasp. I'm a big believer in open science and in building tools that others can learn from, adapt, or even break (and then fix better!).

When I’m not working, I like to wander around with a sketchbook or camera, obsess over [maps](/post/portofolio/#subparagraph3), or dive into old-school biology textbooks for inspiration.

I’m also passionate about **R programming** and education. I create tutorials to help life science researchers make sense of their data using [R](https://github.com/danilyanedo7/biocomp) and build dynamic, interactive, and reproducible reports with R Markdown. Check out my [projects](/#projects) for examples of my work, browse through some of my [educational presentations](https://edodanilyan.com/post/dashboard_collection/), or explore my full [curriculum vitae](https://edodanilyan.com/uploads/resume.pdf).  

I’m always open to exciting collaborations and new challenges. If you’re looking to create something amazing, let’s connect! [Reach out](https://edodanilyan.com/#contact), and let’s see where our ideas can take us.
