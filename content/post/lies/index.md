To those who care,

Some of you might be wondering what kind of post this is. Let me start by saying this, I’ve decided to discontinue the Study Abroad series. Not because the story isn’t worth telling, but because I’m not in a place where I can keep writing it, at least not right now.

I know how some of you see me as bright, kind, full of positivity. But that’s only part of the truth. People aren’t black or white. We’re all grey, we're shaped by our fears, regrets, dreams, and doubts. And if I’m being honest, I’ve been carrying a lot of darkness lately.

Isn’t it strange how the people who show the most love are often the ones who never really felt it themselve? They learned to comfort because no one ever comforted them. They learned to listen because no one ever asked how they felt. They just want someone to notice they’re stuck. But no one sees where that kindness came from. Because it wasn’t taught, it was built in quiet rooms, on alonely nights, annd from wounds they never showed. They give everything, hoping someone might give just enough in return. But most people don’t notice. They’re too used to receiving the love. If that’s you... you might understand me a lil bit better.

I lie sometimes, not to deceive, but fear. Fear of disapointing people. Fear of being rejected. I try to please everyone, keep the peace, avoid conflict, keep the friendships intact. But in doing so, I’ve drifted from who I am. I’ve become someone I don’t recognize,someone I don’t always like.

The truth is, I feel lonely, even in the presence of many. I fear losing people. I fear not being enough. And most days, I’m not sure what I’m holding onto anymore. I built dreams not for myself, but for others, to make my family proud, to meet expectations I never asked for but took on anyway. I survived, not because I was strong, but because I thought I had to.

I’m tired. To my beloved friends, Martin, Galuh, Izza, Biyu, Agung, Daris, Dimas, Bayu, Yaya, Fahmi, and so many others I can’t name one by one, I’m sorry. I slipped. I wasn’t the friend I wanted to be. I let you down in ways I can’t even explain. Tin, if anything happens, please, help my family in any way you can. You know what I mean.

I once said I wanted to live life to the fullest. I wanted to see Banda Naira, get lost in foreign cities, kiss someone under a maple tree. But somewhere along the way, those dreams faded. I may not see rain in Bern. I may not eat pizza in Italy or chase the silly hopes I held onto for so long. 

Tante, adik selalu berusaha buat tante dan om seneng, kita sama sama berjuang melewati banyak hal. Tapi kali ini adik takut akan penolakan. Adik takut buat lihat tate dan om kecewa. Adik sudah lelah sama banyak hal. Maaf ya adik belum bisa jalan lebih jauh lagi, maafkan adik. Adik sayang sekali sama tante dan om.
