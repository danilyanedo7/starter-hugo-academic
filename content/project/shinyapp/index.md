Welcome! This is my first R Shiny project—a collection of simple, interactive apps designed to support biologists working in **biodiversity monitoring** and **species distribution mapping**.

These apps:
- Allow users to upload and explore biodiversity datasets
- Generate **interactive maps** using `leaflet`
- Provide an accessible starting point for **visualizing species distribution patterns**

You can explore the code and try it yourself here:  
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/danilyanedo7/shinyapp_species_distribution)

While these tools are still a work in progress, they're built with the goal of making biodiversity data analysis more **accessible**, **engaging**, and **interactive**, especially for field researchers and students.

### Why I Built This

As a biologist, I often wished for lightweight, user-friendly tools that didn’t require advanced programming knowledge to analyze spatial biodiversity data. Shiny gives us a way to build just that **interactive dashboards powered by R**.

I hope these apps can help others explore their ecological data more intuitively, even as I continue to refine and expand their features.
