## Module: Computational Microbiology in the Microbial Systematics Course

Welcome to **Computational Microbiology**, a core component of the *Microbial Systematics* course. This module was developed to give students practical experience in analyzing microbial diversity and understanding the principles of taxonomy and classification using real-world data.

> This project was created during my time as a **lab assistant** in the Microbial Systematics course at **Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) Surabaya**.

---

## Module Objectives

Students will explore microbial samples from various environments, ranging from soil and water to more specialized ecosystemsâ€”and apply **computational tools in R** to:

- Understand microbial taxonomy and classification
- Retrieve and align genetic sequences
- Construct and interpret phylogenetic trees

---

## What You'll Learn

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   Select diverse microbial species from various ecological niches for phylogenetic analysis.

2. **Genetic Data Retrieval**  
   Access and retrieve DNA sequence data from **GenBank** for selected microbial taxa.

3. **Sequence Alignment**  
   Perform multiple sequence alignment using bioinformatics tools to identify conserved regions and ensure accurate comparisons.

4. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**  
   Build evolutionary trees using methods like **neighbor-joining** or **maximum likelihood**, and learn how different approaches impact the resulting topology.

**Note:** This module is currently available in **Bahasa Indonesia**.
