My name is **Edo Danilyan**, but feel free to call me **Edo**. I’m a PhD researcher at the University of Vienna. 

On this site, you'll find a mix of my scientific work, snapshots from field adventures, and some small but exciting coding projects, mostly in R, sometimes elsewhere. 

You can explore everything chronologically or jump straight to the sections on [code](/tag/r/), [science](/tag/research/), or [fieldwork (photography gallery)](https://danilyan.myportfolio.com/), whatever suits your curiosity. Below, you’ll find my experience, recent publications, projects, and tutorials.
