This corner of the internet belongs to someone who can spend an entire evening fixing a missing parenthesis and call it a productive day. Experiments, code, cameras, and questionable life choices all end up here sooner or later. His name’s Edo, and he’s still convinced this all makes sense.

Some days it’s a plot that finally makes sense. Other days it’s a random photo. Occasionally something profound appears, though it’s usually accidental.

Things got out of hand here long before anyone started calling it a website. You can follow the trail of [code](/tag/r/), get lost in [science](/tag/research/), or peek into the [fieldwork (photography gallery)](https://danilyan.myportfolio.com/) where mud, microbes, and cameras coexist more peacefully than they should. If anything resonates, great. If not, at least the coffee was worth it.
